KEY FINDINGS:

1. Clustering Method: Hierarchical Clustering
2. Parameters Used: n_clusters=3, linkage='average', affinity='euclidean'
3. All suppliers were successfully assigned to clusters
4. Clusters show clear performance differentiation


RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Focus improvement efforts on lower-performing clusters
- Leverage best practices from high-performing clusters
- Monitor cluster boundaries for supplier transitions
- Consider hierarchical structure for supplier management tiers
